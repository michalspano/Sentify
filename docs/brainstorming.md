## Brainstorming

* `Spotify API`:
    * Procedurally generated **landscapes** that change depending on user's data or current song playing.
      * Or a **playlist** that contains a collection of songs that can be used to generate a landscape.
    * Simple user app that tells about your **personality** based on the user data(?)

## How to start

* Create starter `API` endpoint to get the user data
  * This will be defined in the `index.ts` file for now
  * Later, this functionality will be connected to the application's `GUI` to get the user data and display the results from the `API` endpoint
* Create simple `GUI` to show the collected data
  * Web-based `GUI`? It will probably be vanilla `HTML` and `CSS` for now.
* Depending on how we feel, we will see how we proceed after that.
